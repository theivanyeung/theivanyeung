I have extensive experience with Deep Learning neural networks as well as NextJS and Firebase as I am currently using the tech stack to develop Prodicity, a live-streaming platform focused on better interactions between creators and viewers as well as AI moderation. I am also working on DreamMate which is a social media platform allowing college students to further expand their entreprenuerial endevours by finding co-founders and building their team. I am well-versed with JS, Java, and C++, and is currently working with Python for ML/DL R&D. |
|----------------|:----------------|

In the past, I have created and failed two startups, LangSwap and Prodicity. LangSwap, a language-exchange platform, was developed by three founders. Prodicity, a gamified productivity SaaS, was developed by the same three founders with seven employees. 

A bit about me outside my professional life: I enjoy the outdoors and reguarly travel to see the world. Some of my favorite activities include hiking, camping, and skiing. In my free time, I enjoy content creating as I have a Youtube Channel filled with piano content where I utilize 3d visual effects to enhance my performances.
